This program operates by reading the file named "example.in" and then outputting its result into a new file named "example.out".
Due to default CLion settings (the IDE being used), the working directory for files is "cmake-build-debug", and the files are currently found there.

The program supports multiple dimensions as long as they are square: equal number of rows and columns. It is meant to handle the hospital-student stable-matching problem, where there are equal number of hospitals and students.

An "example.in" file is included for reference. This file can be modified to account for new data as long as it remains formatted in the same way.
The line has a number representing the dimension of the hospitals and students, that being how many exist in the problem. Then, for a dimension number of lines, rows of the hospital are listed, then followed by the students for the same dimension number of lines.
